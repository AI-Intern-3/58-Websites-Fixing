### Issue: This Site Can't Be Reached for https://aissms.collegeradio.rocks

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Verify DNS Settings**

   **Check DNS Records:**

   Use the `dig` command to check DNS records for the domain:

   ```bash
   # Check the DNS A record for the domain
   dig aissms.collegeradio.rocks

   # Example output should show the IP address that the domain resolves to
   ```

   **Check DNS Propagation:**

   Use an online DNS propagation checker to verify global propagation of DNS records:

   - Visit [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) or similar DNS propagation checking websites.
   - Enter `aissms.collegeradio.rocks` and review the results.

   **Update DNS Settings:**

   - **Log in to your domain registrarâ€™s control panel (e.g., GoDaddy).**
   - **Navigate to the DNS management section:**
     - **Go to your GoDaddy dashboard.**
     - **Select "My Products" and find your domain.**
     - **Click "DNS" next to the domain name.**
   - **Verify that DNS records (especially A records) are correctly configured to point to the correct IP address of your server.**
   - **If necessary, update the A record or other DNS records.**
   - **Save changes and allow time for DNS propagation.**

**Note:** DNS changes can take time to propagate globally, so if you've made recent changes, it may take up to 48 hours for the updates to be reflected.
